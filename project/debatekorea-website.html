As a lead UX designer and Front-End developer, I was responsible for redesigning a website for Debate Korea, a subsidiary organization of Discover Korea aiming to promote debate education and revitalize the debate community in Korea.</p><p>‍</p><h4>team &amp; timeline</h4><p>From April 2020 to June 2020, I worked with 2 content creators and 2 product designers to finish the project. Our responsibilities included resolving UX/UI issues assigned to milestones, contributing ideas and solutions beyond existing issues, and introducing the proper web development process to the team.</p><p>‍</p><h4>problem</h4><p>Debate is a powerful tool of education that allows individuals to openly express their opinions and develop the skills of critical thinking and persuasion as well as to expand academic and career opportunities. However, debate has yet to become a popular culture in Korea, as many people believe that the debate community is exclusive to the upper class students. Given these stereotypes, many feel intimidated to enter the debate community and don’t look for opportunities even if they want to participate. Although the organization has been established under the mission statement of resolving this issue, the previous website has not been effective in terms of making the users feel comfortable about the debate community. There were no design principles that aligned with the organization&#x27;s core values, and the information architecture made it difficult to navigate information about the organization.<br/></p><p>I audited the previous website to get an understanding of what prospective debaters experience at Debate Korea. According to the site metrics, a high percentage of users were leaving the homepage without interacting with it. To supplement the issues found in the audit, I analyzed the metrics from the non-profit’s last site report to identify the key UX problems: poor navigation and way-finding of critical information, lack of concise context, and vague value proposition.</p><p>‍</p><h4>Research process &amp; design goals</h4><p>Together as a design team, we analyzed other competitors and create a competitor analysis chart. Our potential competitors, such as DebateForall or YTN English Debate Championship, shared the same problem: the website was overloaded with confusing terminology and poorly-designed information architecture, which was overwhelming for students trying to enter the community. Our main goal seemed clear - we have to provide clear and transparent context to help students understand how debating works and how they can enter the community without feeling too overwhelmed.</p><p>Based on the user research, the designers, researchers, and I created design principles:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Cater to main audience:</strong> Students from age 14 to 22, interested in debate education</li><li><strong>Transparent context:</strong> Students need to be informed about the proper process of debating</li><li><strong>Streamlined information architecture:</strong> Key infomation about debating and joining the community should be easy to find so students don’t feel lost and confused about the process</li><li><strong>Constant support:</strong> Students need to understand how Debate Korea will support them</li><li><strong>Feeling of belonging:</strong> Help students feel connected before signing up to any programs</li></ul><p>Gathering the research, the design team and I created the site map, create wireframes, and usability test the website prototype. Throughout this process, our team constantly referred back to the mental model diagram. We would ask ourselves, “does this design support the thought processes and tasks prospective students ask?”</p><p>‍</p><h4>outcome</h4><p>The results for the final website were astounding, and this couldn’t have happened without the thorough research, which ultimately guided our designs.</p><p>This was an amazing journey with the team. We learned that research drives branding, content strategy, and design in their own unique ways. Our non-profit stakeholders are so excited for this web release. This project launched at the beginning of July 2020. Since our launch, we have reduced the bounce rate by approximately 15%.</p><p>‍</p></div><p class="header-paragraph w-dyn-bind-empty"></p><p class="header-paragraph myrole w-dyn-bind-empty"></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="screen-container"><img alt="A screenshot of web page" style="-webkit-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);-moz-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);-ms-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);opacity:0" data-w-id="50fc42ed-e88e-ebab-f6b0-bd5e8e331fbc" src="../images/screencapture-en-debatekorea-org-2021-06-09-23_00_17.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 82vw, (max-width: 767px) 86vw, (max-width: 991px) 87vw, 83vw" srcset="../images/screencapture-en-debatekorea-org-2021-06-09-23_00_17-p-500.jpeg 500w, ../images/screencapture-en-debatekorea-org-2021-06-09-23_00_17-p-800.jpeg 800w, ../images/screencapture-en-debatekorea-org-2021-06-09-23_00_17-p-1080.jpeg 1080w, ../images/screencapture-en-debatekorea-org-2021-06-09-23_00_17.jpg 1344w" class="screen-image"/><div class="button-wrapper-2"><a href="https://jinpark.webflow.io/#Portfolio" class="button-2 w-button">← View all projects</a></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="want-to-work"><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3cfd" class="left-column"><h1 class="hero-heading">Want to</h1><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3d00" class="highlight-box"><div class="highlight"></div><h1 class="hero-heading">talk?</h1></div></div><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3d04" class="right-column"><p>If you are looking for someone to help your company produce visually pleasing and technologically advantageous products, <br/>I am <strong>looking for Summer 2022 Product Design / UX Engineering Internship Roles!
