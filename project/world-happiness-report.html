The project makes use of three CSV files provided in the links: World Happiness Score for the Year 2018 (2018.csv), the Year 2019 (2019.csv), and the Year 2020 (2020.csv). Each of the datasets contains overall happiness scores for around 150 countries and individual scores for the six factors contributing to happiness: economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, perceptions of corruption, and generosity.</p><p>‍</p><h4>team &amp; timeline</h4><p>From April 2021 to May 2021, I worked with 2 teammates to create the visualization. We split up the work evenly to finalize the idea/dataset over the group discussion and create d3 graphs with the group. </p><p>‍</p><h4>Scenario</h4><p>We are curious about what countries are the happiest ones and what countries are the least happy. To achieve this, we decided to generate a world map with labels of happiness score and coloring scale indicative of rankings. </p><p><br/></p><p>We are also interested in how each factor contributes to life satisfaction and if there is a relationship between them and overall happiness. We decided to make a scatter plot to explore such relationships between the factors that were used to determine the overall rankings, as well as to visualize any patterns that may exist for different regions around the world. We explicitly chose the dataset from the year 2020, as it is the dataset that contains the most up-to-date information. </p><p><br/></p><p>The scatter plot used eight columns included in the dataset: Country, Regional Indicator, Score, Logged GDP per Capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom to make Life Choices, Generosity, and Perceptions of Corruption. Score, which represents the overall happiness score, was selected to serve as the dependent variable presented on the Y-Axis of the scatter plot. Country was selected to serve as each point represented on the scatter plot, and Regional Indicator was selected to serve as the baseline for the regional filtering feature. Other columns were selected to serve as the independent variables presented on the X-Axis of the plot. These columns include objective information like logged GDP per capita and life expectancy, as well as subjective binary responses to survey questions. </p><p><br/></p><h4>Research process &amp; design goals</h4><p><strong>The first diagram</strong> utilizes the GeoJson dataset to draw the world map. There is a 1px white border gap between countries to emphasize different countries in a clear and aesthetic manner. Then, the diagram utilizes happiness score data from three datasets of three years (2018.csv, 2019.csv, and 2020.csv). First, we got the maximum and minimum happiness scores among all three datasets. Then, we decided to use a color scale that has 11 different colors for different happiness scores ranging from 2.5 to 8.0. We picked the colors from d3.schemeRdYlBu so that it’s a discrete divergent scale with blue representing lower scores(unhappy), red representing higher scores(happy), and yellow representing middle scores. We made this color choice because we believe blue is often associated with sadness while red/orange is associated with lively energy. Finally, we colored each country on the graph based on the corresponding color of its happiness score on the scale. In the beginning, we used a continuous divergent scale so that each score corresponds to a different color. We eventually decided against it because too many colors confuse the visualization and make it difficult to match the colors with the legend. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Lastly, in order to incorporate three years’ data onto one single world map graph, we decided to use buttons to switch the year of the data that the graph is presenting. Thus, we created three buttons and put them right below the color legend for users to interact with them. We initially tried to use sliders to switch years. However, this gives an impression of years in progress, which is not the focus of our graph.</p><p>‍</p><p>To display happiness scores for three years on the world map, we added three buttons (Year 2018, 2019, 2020) at the bottom of the map so that users could click on them and see global happiness scores of that specific year. Another interaction of the world map is that users could hover around each country on the map and a label with the country name and its happiness score will pop up. For the scatterplot, we checkbox-based filtering systems by regions on the right side of the graph that users could choose to see countries of specific regions. We also added six buttons at the bottom, each corresponding to one of the six factors that determine happiness. When the user clicks the button, a new scatter plot representing the relationship between the chosen factor and the happiness scores for each country is displayed with a transitioning effect. Finally, hovering over a specific point displays a tooltip that contains relevant information about the selected country.</p><p>‍</p><p>We intended to display a global view of how happy each country is and if there’s any general trend across regions. We figured it would be more reasonable to indicate happiness level through implicit factors such as hues and colors. Hence we made the detail (country names and scores) invisible at first and they will show up only if users are interested in certain countries and try to hover around them on the map. Later we decided that it would be clearer if when users choose a certain country, that specific one is emphasized somehow on the world map. To achieve this, we increased the opacity of unchosen areas. Additionally, to provide information for three years, we tried different interactions until we found the most appropriate one. At first, we tried to use a slider but that could be confusing as the scores for the three years are independent while a slider tends to indicate a cumulative relationship through time. This was pointed out by our peers at the demo and we moved on to using buttons instead. With three separate buttons at the bottom of the map, it’s much more indicative of the independent relationship between years and it also looks better aesthetically. </p><p>‍<br/></p><p><strong>The second diagram</strong> focuses only on 2020 data and explores the relationship between the happiness score and the factors affecting it. We chose to make a scatter plot because each country can be represented by a circle and a scatter plot is perfect for visualizing relationships. Thus, we decided to vary the circle’s radius based on the country’s population so that more attention will be drawn to bigger countries. Also, we decided to color the circles based on the regions that the countries are in. There are a total of 10 regions including Western Europe, North America, and ANZ, Middle East and North Africa, Latin America and Caribbean, Central and Eastern Europe, East Asia, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the Independent States. We used “Tableau 10” to color them since they are perfect for categorical data. The legend at the right of the scatter plot is also implemented as an interactive filter so that users can only view the regions they care about. We also chose to set the opacity of the circles to be 0.9 instead of 1 since many circles overlap and it’s easier to view all the circles when the opacity is 0.9.</p><p><br/></p><p>The y-axis of the scatter plot is the happiness score while the x-axis of the scatter plot can be chosen from 6 factors: Perceptions of Corruption, Social Support, Generosity, Logged GDP per Capita, Healthy Life Expectancy, and Freedom to make Life Choices. We chose to fix the y-axis as the happiness score because it is the dependent variable and we vary the x-axis to see how each factor, as an independent variable, affects the happiness score. We utilize buttons to switch among these 6 factors. The scale of the y-axis ranges from 0 to 8 for the happiness score; whereas the scale of the x-axis varies with the selected factor, extending the minimum to the maximum value of that particular factor’s range. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p>We intended to show the relationship between the six factors and the overall happiness scores. However, we did not want the users to overload themselves with too much information represented on a single plot, or scroll through the page to find the wanted information. Thus, we decided to build buttons that enable users to explore the relationships with a simple click. Since the y-axis is fixed to be a happiness score, we placed the buttons right below the x-axis so the interaction is more discoverable and natural. Since there are so many countries represented in one plot, we thought that it would be difficult for users to eye-track the numbers. Therefore, the interactive tooltips were added so that users can easily find detailed information for each circle (country). Lastly, we thought that many users would prefer to compare countries in similar regions. While the world map supports this feature naturally, the scatter plot does not. Therefore, we decided to color-code countries based on regions, and added the interactive filtering system utilizing a list of checkboxes. The list of checkboxes is located right next to the graph, which makes it easily discoverable. We utilized “Tableau 10” colors for indicating each region, a scale designed for representing categorical colors. All colors  in the scale greatly vary in terms of hue and do not utilize luminosity or saturation to display their difference, which makes them ideal for representing categorical data.</p><p><br/></p><h4>outcome</h4><p>The world map tells us happiness score leaders in the world. European countries are clearly the world leaders of “Happiness”, with Scandinavian countries ranked at the top in the world. Sub-Saharan African countries are the lowest on the “Happiness” scale. North America, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand follow right after - this suggests that there exists a relationship between the nation’s GDP and overall happiness scale. Indeed, with this question in mind, viewers can better understand the second diagram, which explores the reasons behind the happiness score. Moreover, we see an overall increase in happiness score from 2018 to 2019, and a decrease from 2019 to 2020. I believe that Covid-19 happening in 2020 can be responsible for the decrease of the happiness score across the world. </p><p><br/></p><p>The scatter plot was helpful in visualizing the landscape of data included in the report. We found that as certain variables increased such as health, economy, and trust of government, the overall rank of happiness increased. This was substantial as it gave us an understanding of happiness on a macro level. While manipulating and plotting certain grafts we realized that there certainly was a linear relationship with these informative variables. Many countries in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America show that happiness rank decreases with factors such as health, economy, and trust of government are low. However, we noticed that as we got closer to the top rankings and countries became more even across some of the informative variables, some of the smaller variables were the differentiators. This was an important discovery as it led us to understand how the top countries were ranked. </p><p><br/></p></div><p class="header-paragraph w-dyn-bind-empty"></p><p class="header-paragraph myrole w-dyn-bind-empty"></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="screen-container"><img alt="A screenshot of web page" style="-webkit-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);-moz-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);-ms-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);opacity:0" data-w-id="50fc42ed-e88e-ebab-f6b0-bd5e8e331fbc" src="../images/worldhappiness%20full.png" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 82vw, (max-width: 767px) 86vw, (max-width: 991px) 87vw, 83vw" srcset="../images/worldhappiness%20full-p-500.png 500w, ../images/worldhappiness%20full-p-800.png 800w, ../images/worldhappiness%20full-p-1080.png 1080w, ../images/worldhappiness%20full.png 1920w" class="screen-image"/><div class="button-wrapper-2"><a href="https://jinpark.webflow.io/#Portfolio" class="button-2 w-button">← View all projects</a></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="want-to-work"><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3cfd" class="left-column"><h1 class="hero-heading">Want to</h1><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3d00" class="highlight-box"><div class="highlight"></div><h1 class="hero-heading">talk?</h1></div></div><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3d04" class="right-column"><p>If you are looking for someone to help your company produce visually pleasing and technologically advantageous products, <br/>I am <strong>looking for Summer 2022 Product Design / UX Engineering Internship Roles!
