The project discusses how movement data can be collected and framed on a mobile phone platform, so it can help students understand and quantify symptoms of stress. I was responsible for developing an algorithm that clusters location data used to support an application that visualizes data and creates custom feedback for the user. I also contributed to the UX¬†design of the prototype of this mobile intervention, which was made as a proof of concept of how movement data can indicate stress, and how proper data framing can bring mental health awareness.</p><p>‚Äç</p><h4>team &amp; timeline</h4><p>From October 2019 to December 2019, I worked with 1 product designer to finish the project. We split the work evenly and provided thorough feedback to each other&#x27;s work to deliver a polished final product.</p><p>‚Äç</p><h4>problem</h4><p>As technology becomes increasingly pervasive in our everyday lives, its purpose has expanded beyond professional use to personal use. Ubiquitous technology targets many aspects of a user‚Äôs personal lives, and research includes a growing interest in health applications. Health interventions can range from weight management, to drug overdose sensing, support for elderly loneliness, and has stress management. At Cornell University, there is a large community shift to bring focus to the mental health of students, as it can not only negatively affect their academic lives but personal lives as well. The Presiding President of the university, Martha Pollack, declared in late 2019 that ‚ÄúWe really ‚Ä¶ need to be talking about mental health and student wellness very holistically‚Äù.</p><p>Our research delves into the product design and implementation of a platform named ‚ÄúWhereabouts‚Äù. This platform leverages mobile device sensors to collect location data of a user and to build a stronger image of their mental health wellbeing. We aim to find a relationship between location movement and stress and to help Cornell students bring awareness to their own stress and mood and what healthy activities help them cope.</p><p>‚Äç</p><h4>Research process &amp; design goals</h4><p>We hypothesize that mental health wellbeing is significantly related to routine physical movement from different locations. The locational movement can help indicate the health of a student, such as, changes in routine, increased visits to a favorite place, and extreme amounts of decreased movement. Additionally, we predict that a platform that can provide an indication of users‚Äô mental well-being through analysis of locational data, will allow users to self-reflect more effectively about their own wellbeing in real time.</p><p>‚Äç</p><p>Our study is broken into three separate investigations. </p><p>1. What relationship exists between location movement and student stress? Does there exist a significant relationship between physical activity and stress? If so, what is the correlation? </p><p>2. How can location data be collected from a mobile device and processed to predict a general state of mental health? If stress is correlated to movement, how can we design an algorithm that will help collect such data? We will investigate how sensor data may be collected and processed to produce predictions of mental wellbeing. </p><p>3. How can movement information be framed so that our app is an effective intervention? Lastly, what type of information are students looking for in a mental health awareness application? How can an application be best designed to develop a consistent and reliable repertoire with its users?</p><p>Please find the link to the full-length document at the top of the page for further details! üßÄ</p><p>‚Äç</p><h4>outcome</h4><p>Despite the interest from the course instructors and our passion to further develop this project, we were unfortunately unable to continue developing due to personal reasons and the global pandemic. However, project Whereabouts will always remain in my heart as the first ux research / product design project that changed my career interest and my future. I would like to honor <a href="https://www.emilychin.info/">Emily Chin</a>, my project partner, for bringing exceptional technical &amp; design talent that allowed us to execute and ship extremely fast.</p><p>‚Äç</p></div><p class="header-paragraph w-dyn-bind-empty"></p><p class="header-paragraph myrole w-dyn-bind-empty"></p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="screen-container"><img alt="A screenshot of web page" style="-webkit-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);-moz-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);-ms-transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);transform:translate3d(0, 60PX, 0) scale3d(1, 1, 1) rotateX(0) rotateY(0) rotateZ(0) skew(0, 0);opacity:0" data-w-id="50fc42ed-e88e-ebab-f6b0-bd5e8e331fbc" src="../images/whereaboutsfull.png" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 82vw, (max-width: 767px) 86vw, (max-width: 991px) 87vw, 83vw" srcset="../images/whereaboutsfull-p-500.png 500w, ../images/whereaboutsfull-p-800.png 800w, ../images/whereaboutsfull.png 1200w" class="screen-image"/><div class="button-wrapper-2"><a href="https://jinpark.webflow.io/#Portfolio" class="button-2 w-button">‚Üê¬†View all projects</a></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="want-to-work"><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3cfd" class="left-column"><h1 class="hero-heading">Want to</h1><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3d00" class="highlight-box"><div class="highlight"></div><h1 class="hero-heading">talk?</h1></div></div><div data-w-id="f4f04428-8e83-23ee-dfff-02c24ace3d04" class="right-column"><p>If you are looking for someone to help your company produce visually pleasing and technologically advantageous products, <br/>I am <strong>looking for Summer 2022 Product Design / UX¬†Engineering Internship Roles!
